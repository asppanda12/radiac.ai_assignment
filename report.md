# Campaign Agent Evaluation Report

## Validation Approach

1. **Schema Compliance**
   - Implemented Pydantic models for strict type checking
   - Automated validation of required fields and data types
   - Unit tests for schema compliance

2. **Business Logic Testing**
   - Budget allocation validation
   - Channel coverage verification
   - Ad group and creative uniqueness checks

3. **Content Quality**
   - Manual review of generated ad copies
   - Tone and brand alignment checking
   - Character limit compliance

## Key Limitations

1. **Limited Context**
   - No historical performance data
   - Lacks competitive landscape awareness
   - Missing brand voice examples

2. **Validation Gaps**
   - Basic creative quality checks
   - Limited audience targeting validation
   - No cross-channel consistency checking

3. **Technical Constraints**
   - Single model dependency
   - Synchronous processing
   - No feedback loop integration

## Improving Hallucination Control

### Current State
The agent may hallucinate:
- Product features
- Performance metrics
- Audience behaviors

### Production Improvement Plan

1. **Knowledge Base Integration**
   ```python
   class GroundedAgent(CampaignAgent):
       def __init__(self, kb_path: str):
           self.kb = load_knowledge_base(kb_path)
           self.product_facts = self.kb.get_product_facts()
           self.performance_metrics = self.kb.get_metrics()
   ```

2. **Fact Checking Pipeline**
   ```python
   def validate_creative(creative: Creative) -> bool:
       facts = extract_claims(creative.body)
       return all(verify_fact(f, self.product_facts) for f in facts)
   ```

3. **Metrics-Based Validation**
   - Track hallucination rates
   - Implement confidence scoring
   - Build feedback loop with actual performance

4. **Implementation Timeline**
   - Week 1: KB schema design
   - Week 2: Fact extraction system
   - Week 3: Validation pipeline
   - Week 4: Monitoring and metrics
